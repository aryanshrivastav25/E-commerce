IoC: When we create objects, it is our responsibility to create and delete objects, so we use IoC(Inversion of Control)
We provide the Control of creation of object to frameworks and those objects are stored in IoC Containers.

DI: Dependency Injection, if 2 objects are there in a IoC container and we want to use one object in another object, then we use Dependency Injection.

Objects created and managed by spring are called beans.
The objects are created using the ApplicationContext class object.
This is object is returned by the SpringApplication.run(SpringDemoApplication.class, args); which returns the child class of ApplicationContext, which we can store in ApplicationContext object.


Layers in Spring Web Application:
1. Controller: Accepts request and send back data.
2. Service: Does all the processing of data.
3. Repository: Also DAO(Data Access Object), connects to database.

An object called mode(like Alien, Desktop, Laptop which is an entity in the database is passed between the layers).


Servlets: Classes in java which accepts, process and send back the https requests on web. They are implemented using Servlet Container also called Web Conatainer.
