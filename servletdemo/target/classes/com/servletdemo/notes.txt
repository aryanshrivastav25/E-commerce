JSP: Jakarta server Pages or Java Server Pages.
Servlets accepts data from the client and process it.
JSP is a technology which integrates Java code in between HTML.

Servlets(Controller) get data from client and then send it to JSP(View) in the form of Objects(Model) to display it on frontend.
This technique is called MVC.

Tomcat Server can only contain Servlet, so any JSP page is automatically converted to JSP.
